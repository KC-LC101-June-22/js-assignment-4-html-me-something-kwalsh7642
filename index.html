            <h1>Why I Think Everyone Should Have Houseplants</h1>
            <img id="img1" src="images/IMG_5341.jpeg" alt="Plants on a windowsill">
            <p class="blogtext">My journey into the world of houseplants started during the beginning of the pandemic. 
               I was bored, shut-in, and in need of a relaxing routine,  
               and the idea of bringing more of a natural element into my 
               household appealed to me. It gradually transformed from a hobby 
               of mine to a passion  of mine. Through this experience, I have 
               learned to be patient and the value of taking the time to slow 
               down and invest dedication to a long-term result. I've also 
               learned to accept that some things you will go through in life 
               will require trial and error, and each mistake (read plant death)
                you make is OKAY, as long as you have taken the opportunity to
                 learn from it. Lastly, if all of this commentary is coming 
                 off as too sappy (pun intended), more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419447/#:~:text=Our%20results%20suggest%20that%20active,%2C%20soothed%2C%20and%20natural%20feelings">studies</a> in science are 
                 showing a potential link between caring for/ being around 
                 plants and improved mental health <link>. If you are 
                 interested by these same things, I'd like this page to be a 
                 useful tool to help you with your journey towards setting up 
                 your own planted paradise.</p>
