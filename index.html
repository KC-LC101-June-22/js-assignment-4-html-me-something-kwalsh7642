            <p class="blogtext">My journey into the world of houseplants started during the beginning of the pandemic. 
               I was bored, shut-in, and in need of a relaxing routine,  
               and the idea of bringing more of a natural element into my 
               household appealed to me. It gradually transformed from a hobby 
               of mine to a passion  of mine. Through this experience, I have 
               learned to be patient and the value of taking the time to slow 
               down and invest dedication to a long-term result. I've also 
               learned to accept that some things you will go through in life 
               will require trial and error, and each mistake (read plant death)
                you make is OKAY, as long as you have taken the opportunity to
                 learn from it. Lastly, if all of this commentary is coming 
                 off as too sappy (pun intended), more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419447/#:~:text=Our%20results%20suggest%20that%20active,%2C%20soothed%2C%20and%20natural%20feelings">studies</a> in science are 
                 showing a potential link between caring for/ being around 
                 plants and improved mental health. If you are 
                 interested by these same things, I'd like this page to be a 
                 useful tool to help you with your journey towards setting up 
                 your own planted paradise.</p>

               There are many types of plants that can survive a life indoors, if given the proper care and conditions. Most of the plants I have are aroids, which is a term that encompasses a variety of plants that share similar traits and growth habitats. To put things in simplistic terms, aroids tend to grow low to the ground or underneath the cover or shade of other plants. In their natural environments, they are able to withstand flood conditions. These traits make an aroid plant a hardier and more forgiving choice for a novice plant enthusiast, and are readily available in most stores. Succulents and cacti are another type of plant that gets recommended to beginners, as well as ferns and some begonias. I won’t speak further on those types, because I have killed many of them. (I’ve added another section of resources you may use to look further into this types of plants, and wish you luck.)

            <h1>Substrate Types and Tips</h1>

               One of the first things to nail down as a plant parent is what type of substrate you should use as a growing medium for your plant. Generally, a good rule of thumb is to research the specific plant you have in mind, as well as it’s habitat it’s from. The category of plant (e.g aroid or cacti) will help you understand what kind of treatment it can tolerate. You may remember me mentioning earlier that aroids can tolerate flood conditions. This means that they can also be propagated or even grown in water,  when provided the correct nutrients. This is a technique called hydroponics and something worth looking into, if you like the idea of adding and monitoring the nutrient levels of your plant’s reservoir. I am lazier, so I choose to use soil as my growth substrate.

            <p class="blogtext">
               In my opinion, there is no such thing as an all purpose soil. Chances are, the more you venture into collecting plants, the more diverse your collection will be. A plant that is native to the desert will have different soil conditions and requirements than a plant native to Ecuador. It just makes sense that your soil will be diverse as well. Googling a soil recipe for your specific plant is a good place to start formulating your own recipe. Just remember—some plants have a root system that require more oxygen than others, and if you don’t aerate your soil with rocks, bark, sand, perlite, etc., then your root will be susceptible to root rot and other disease. Imitating the nutrient/soil conditions your plant has in the wild is key to keeping a plant happy indoors.

            <h1>Lighting</h1>
            <div id="img-text">

               Lighting is another key factor to consider when you are looking at plants. Natural lighting is obviously the best, and south facing windows  would  be an appropriate place to put full sun-loving plants. For plants that enjoy a medium amount of light, or shade, west or west facing windows are appropriate. If you are in a place that has poor lighting conditions, grow lights may be a better option for you. Keep in mind, however, that their light is less powerful than sunlight, so your plants will probably require more time with them on, versus a natural sun cycle. Also try to keep the distance between the plant and your light in mind as well. The further a plant is away from its light source, the longer its stem will grow to reach it and the fewer the leaves will be on the stem, causing the plant to look “leggy”. However, if you place your plant too close to a light, its leaves will burn. “Listen” to your plant by taking note of its growth patterns. A happy plant will look vibrant and fuller/bushy, while a neglected plant may appear sparse and dull. If you have plants with variegation or colorful leaves, sometimes too much or too little will affect the coloration of future leaves.

               Again, the best practice when it comes to watering your plant is looking up where your plant natively grows. Is your plant found in a rainforest? Chances are, it may need to have consistently moist soil. This requires more time and effort on your part, with consideration to your home’s climate. Indoors are generally dry and lacking the ideal humidity for tropical plants. In some cases, extra sources of humidity is required, such as a humidifier, a humidity dome, or a humidity tray (which is just a tray of pebbles submerged in water). If you are really dedicated, you can get an indoor greenhouse for your home, or look up IKEA hacks for their glass display cases. This is a costly and labor intensive route I haven’t tried yet, but hey, let me know how it goes if you do it.

               Ugh. Unfortunately, pests WILL be an issue for you at some point. From the produce we bring in, to the windows we open, to the sources we get our plants from, pests can come from a variety of places. Familiarize yourself with common ones that are specific to your plant species by googling “common pests of (so-and-so) species”. Some pests are worse than others in terms of eradicating them. Some plants you can save by treating their leaves with rubbing alcohol and flushing the soil with water. Some pests are more resilient and make you want to burn everything down. These feelings are valid, but keep in mind, the best practice to prevent pests from invading your plants is going to a trustworthy retailer, growing from seed or cutting, and/or treating every new plant with insecticide as soon as it enters your home and quarantining it. After a few weeks, you should be able to determine whether it has pests (some lay eggs in the soil —gross) and act accordingly.

               Everyone starts somewhere, and while some of these plants may not be the most aesthetically exciting for your foray into houseplants, starting off with a plant that requires little to no maintenance overall can help fuel that rewarding experience that comes from plant parenthood. My plant recommendation to anyone who is new and forgetful is a ZZ plant. ZZ plants are low-light tolerant, and rarely need watering. They stored water in the same way tubers (e.g. potatoes) do so they are a true “set it and forget it” type of plant. They also can tolerate being root-bound, which is when the plant’s roots grow so long that they spiral and tangle into themselves, usually a sign that your plant needs repotting.
            </p>
            <p class="blogtext">
               If you need a plant with a bit more razzmatazz, I’d recommend a Pothos plant. Pothos look like Ivy plants, but with spade-like leaves. They can tolerate some drought, so if you forget to water it past a few days than you should, it’d likely bounce back fast. They also come in a variety of colors and variegation patterns, so you have a few options to choose from.
